== Monolith Application

Splitting up a monolith is difficult

* Defining bounded contexts
* Defining interfaces between new microservices
* Architecture without transactions
* Asynchronous execution
* The list goes on...

=== My own experience

Many developers (at least the ones I have spoken to) are not experienced in developing highly distributed systems.

Microservices are developed as if it is still a monolith.

Network communication is handled like method calls in the monolith.

This is however very far from reality. Many more moving parts with the added complexity of network is a failure waiting to happen unless handled properly.

=== What can go wrong?

* Slow Response
** A slow response is worse than no response!
* Blocked Threads
* Cascading Failure

=== Thread Contention

Slow response -> Blocked threads -> Thread contention -> Cascading failure

=== How big should our thread pool be?

Littleâ€™s law says that the number of requests in a system equals the rate at which they arrive, multiplied by the average amount of time it takes to service an individual request.

== Create bulkheads in your software

* Message queues
* Asynchronous communication
* Never trust default timeouts
